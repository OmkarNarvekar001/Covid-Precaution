# Covid-Precaution

Covid 19 pandemic is bringing adverse effects to the entire mankind but in order to break the chain and stop the spread of Covid 19 we have to take proper precautions and follow the rules proposed by our government. Rules like maintaining safe distance between every individual, avoid overcrowding, and wearing mask are some which will surely help in putting an end to the spread of this deadly virus. In the past many technologies are used in order to make sure proper prevention is taken by the people and the rules are followed which are mentioned above. Our project can surely play a vital role in helping the organization make sure that protocols are properly followed by integrating our project with their CCTV systems and can be deployed in monitoring people in places like railway stations, shopping malls, etc. The paper consists of three parts.

Speciality: Propotional distance measurement without using focal length of camera or distance between camera and object

• To check whether a particular number of people are present in a room or any public place to prevent large social gathering using YOLO V3 object detection model.

• To ensure people are maintaining required amount of distance between each other and setting a minimum required distance without using focal length of camera, angle of declination, distance between camera and object.

• To ensure and check whether a person is wearing a mask using support vector machine classification algorithm.

The objective is to reduce transmission, delaying the epidemic peak, reducing the size of the epidemic peak, and spreading cases over a longer time to relieve pressure on the healthcare system.It is an action taken to minimize contact with other individuals. It has been suggested that maintaining a distance of approximately 2 metres from another individual, preventing social gathering and wearing mask result in a marked reduction in transmission of most flu virus strains, including COVID-19.
